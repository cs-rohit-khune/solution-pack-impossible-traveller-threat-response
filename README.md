## Overview

### Introduction

*Impossible Traveller Threat Response Solution Pack* is designed to provide a set of investigation and utility playbooks to respond to Concurrent Successful Authentications To the Same Account From Multiple Countries. SIEM usually picks up and reports these events.

Configure SIEM ingestion using connectors such as Fortinet FortiSIEM. The ingestion process creates an alert of type 'Concurrent Login' and manually triggers the response workflow.

Refer to Simulation Scenario - **Concurrent Successful Authentications** to experience the use case without a SIEM configuration.

### Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to understand how to Simulate and Reset scenarios.

This Solution Pack ships with the following simulation scenarios. 

**Concurrent Successful Authentications**

The scenario generates a demo alert of Type **Concurrent Login**.

Navigate to generated alert and observe that the destination IP address is present to analyze the case.

**Investigate Concurrent Login from Different Geo Location:**

Launch the **Investigate Concurrent Login from Different Geo Location** playbook and observe various investigation activities such as

- Identify the geolocation from where concurrent login was observed
- Get the user's details, who is attempting concurrent login, from Microsoft's Active Directory
- Check login activity of the user for the last 4 hours
- Disable the user for an hour with the IT team's approval
- If the user attempts to log in again, reset the user's password
