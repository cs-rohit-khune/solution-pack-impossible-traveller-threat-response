## Overview

**Impossible Traveller Threat Response Solution Pack** is designed to provide a set of investigation and utility playbooks to respond to Concurrent Successful Authentications To the Same Account From Multiple Countries. SIEM usually picks up and reports these events.

Configure SIEM ingestion using connectors such as Fortinet FortiSIEM. The ingestion process creates an alert of type 'Concurrent Login' and manually triggers the response workflow.
